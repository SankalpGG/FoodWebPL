#  Food Web Pl
This repository contains a Python-based CLI project that I built in high school as a simplified replica of the Zomato web platform, using MySQL as the backend database. The main program is stored in pl.py, while the DB folder includes a suitable replica of the database used during development. The project was created under classroom guidelines, so it focuses purely on logic without any graphics and implements only a subset of the actual platform’s features. It stands as an early exploration of integrating Python with SQL and building functional menu-driven applications.
